  <h1>Many high-elo Yasuo mains are known to dodge every single skillshot in skirmishes and pull out such a beautiful outplay with the multi-people ult, as you see in montages.<br>
  The secret related to this is, that it is not necessary at all.</h1>
  <p style="font-size:22px";>Yasuo can both be the initiator or the followup, but typically is used as the followup.<br> not the followup for hoping your teammate to knock up 5 enemies for you, no. How he approaches the fight is important.
  For example, If a fairly well-farmed Yasuo approaches the fight from the enemies' backline, it is highly likely that the fight is going to be a win.<br>

  <h3 style="font-size:25px;color:turquoise"> The one fact you should keep in mind all the time, is that the reason why Yasuo is considered a difficult champion is because he has such a versatile kit.
  <br> meaning that in some games, you might wanna go for a risky play. In some games, you should build triforce into tank items. In some games, you should get a Frozen Mallet and use yourself as a ADC peel tool.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Georgia', sans-serif;color:gold;" >There are two most important things to keep in mind when playing Yasuo in teamfights. His wind wall utility and his sweeping blade (E).
  <br> Sweeping blade, there are more to talk about in Mechanics and Tricks session, but Wind walling the enemies' abilities can completely turn the fight around. </h2>
